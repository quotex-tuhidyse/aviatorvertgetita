## Understanding the Concept of Halal Trading

In Islam, halal refers to practices that are permissible according to
Islamic law. When it comes to trading, halal trading involves avoiding
certain activities that are considered prohibited, such as gambling,
excessive risk-taking, and interest-based transactions.
